This is the biggest of them all and it is really fun to skate. 
It consists of: a big roll in (about 10-11ft) into the foam pit; a bowl with a 5ft  7ft and i think 8ft drop in; a jump box area starting with a 7ft drop in; 10ft drop in with a spine; jump box onto the resi; a lot of rails and ledges and flat banks; dragon's tail; mini halfpipe; new 10ft vert halfpipe; new 5ft halfpipe;new pumptrack; a few extra quarter pipes;  a cafe; an upstairs area (only for non skaters); mini skate/scoot shop; BMX shop and a mini skatepark called ramp ratz nextdoor for toddlers.
As I said this park is really good and really big but this means it is very busy and a lot of snakes. When going down the roll in into the foam pit people cut out in front of you,about 7 people have done tha to me  and it just gets a little interfering with  your skating.
It is very much just for skating it’s not a great place to just chill and go on whenever you like, for example upstairs is for parents and people who are not skating only and everywhere is very loud, but still this place is very fun to skate and it’s a ‘must go’ place.

Streelight Project is awesome, with the upstairs cafe, kids area,  pool table, Playstation ,Mini halfpipe, spine, 4 and 5 ft drop in, roll in, jump box, wall and a few ledges and rails it makes this place an awesome place to hang out.  It has a great atmosphere and everyone there is really friendly and lots of people to help out with your skating including all the team riders and the staff. It is a smaller park than prevail but is a nicer place to be and a great place to hang out and have fun skating! Out of the 3 this one is my favoutite and is a definitely a “must go”  place and there is no down sides to this park!

Weymouth skatepark is so fun to skate it is half outdoor half outdoor with lots of ramps:
7ft half pipe with 8.5 ft extension, 5ft spine, Treds Bowl, 10ft & 8ft roll in, 5ft fun box, 12ft elvis, 6ft step up volcano/2 ft. The other side with, 6ft quarter pipe to 4 stair set/wall ride and step up and 4ft mini ramp with volcano. Also there's a great indoor mini park for beginners, with mini rails, 2 ft ramps, roll in and box’s etc. It’s great but sometimes it can get bombarded with scooter riders people can snake you but to be honest you’ll find that everywhere, if you're looking for a skateboard only park, well, good luck! This being said they do host a few skateboard only nights. It is a good place to hangout with a cafe and a mini shop and it has a lot of events happening like last week claudius vertesi the famous scooter rider came to the Front Skate Park. This is a awesome park and again this is a “must go” park.
